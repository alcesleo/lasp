## Special forms

### def

Defines a symbol in the global environment.

Parameters `(symbol value)`:

1. The name to refer to the value as a symbol (no other type is allowed).
2. The value to refer to, can be almost anything.

```clojure
(def five 5)
five ; => 5
```


### fn

Creates a function.

Parameters `(parameters body)`

1. A list of parameters that the function shall accept, e.g. `(arg1 arg2)`, `(one two & others)`, `(& args)`
2. The body of the function, the declared parameters will be available in here.

```clojure
; This creates a function object, it can be read as "a function of x".
(fn (x) (+ x 2)) ; => #<Fn (x)>

; Functions are called when placed as the first item in a form:
((fn (x) (+ x 2)) 40) ; => 42
```

Most of the time, you'll want to define a function before using it (see [defn](#defn)):

```clojure
(def plus-two (fn (x) (+ x 2)))
(plus-two 40) ; => 42
```

Functions will enforce that the correct number of arguments is passed to them:

```clojure
; Here we pass 2 arguments to a 1-arity function, and we get an error:
(plus-two 40 41) ; !> Lasp::ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)
```

Functions can also accept any number of extra arguments as a list:

```clojure
(def show-args
  (fn (one & others)
    (list one others)))

; All arguments after the fixed first one will be passed in as a list:
(show-args 1 2 3) ; => (1 (2 3))

; If only the arguments before the & are passed in, it will be an empty list:
(show-args 1) ; => (1 ())

; The arguments before the & are compulsory:
(show-args) ; !> Lasp::ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1+)
```


### do

Executes multiple forms in order and returns the result of the last one.
This is useful when you need to have a single form that does several things.

```clojure
; This form will both print "hello" and return 3:
(do (println "hello") (+ 1 2))
; hello
; => 3
```

### if

If the first form is truthy, evaluates the second form, otherwise it evaluates the third form.

Parameters `(test true-form false-form)`:

1. Always evaluated to test which form to proceed with.
2. Evaluated only when the first argument is truthy.
3. Evaluated only when the first argument is falsy.

```clojure
(if (= 1 1)
  "yep!"
  (println "not evaled!")) ; => "yep!"
```


### quote

Returns a form as is, without evaluating it.

```clojure
f               ; !> KeyError: key not found: f
(quote f)       ; => f
(quote (f 1 2)) ; => (f 1 2)

; Quote ignores any extra arguments
(quote f g)     ; => f
```

You can also use the shorthand syntax `'` to quote forms:

```clojure
'f       ; => f
'(f 1 2) ; => (f 1 2)
```

There is no difference between lists that you use to store data and the lists
that make up your program, therefore quoting a form and calling the
[`list`](#list) function have the same effect:

```clojure
(list 1 2 3) ; => (1 2 3)
'(1 2 3)     ; => (1 2 3)
```

These are both lists to start with, the difference is that the first one is
evaluated and the `list` function returns a list of its arguments, and the
second one is simply not evaluated and the list is returned as is.


### macro

Macros can restructure forms before they are evaluated - they work like
functions but accept their arguments before evaluation. Instead the result of
the macro is evaluated.

Functions:

1. Evaluate all the arguments in order.
2. Call the function with the arguments.
3. Return the result.

Macros:

1. Call the macro with the forms it was given as arguments.
2. Evaluate the return value of the macro.
3. Return the result.

```clojure
(def infix
  ; Accept arguments in natural order for maths operators
  (macro (form)
    ; Return a list of arguments in correct prefix-notation to be run
    (list (second form) (first form) (last form))))

; This will be restructured to `(+ 4 5)` before it is run.
(infix (4 + 5)) ; => 9
```

Except for the order of evaluation, macros behave just like functions and can
accept rest-arguments etc. the same way. Just like functions, you mostly want
to define them before you use them, see [defm](#defm).

To debug macros and see what they expand to without trying to evaluate the result, see [macroexpand](#macroexpand).
