# LÃ¤sp changelog

## v0.3.2

Fix bug in `do` - it accidentally returned part of the AST, now it correctly
returns the result of the last expression.

## v0.3.1

Make readline support actually work once released to rubygems by implementing it directly in Ruby.

It does not seem to remember history between runs like rlwrap did, but trying
to deploy an interactive bash script to rubygems is just too much of a headache
and this is almost as nice with just a single line of Ruby.

## v0.3.0

Add readline support in the REPL using rlwrap, this makes the REPL a **lot** nicer to use.

## v0.2.0

Add support for hash-maps with the following added functions to the core library:

- `hash-map`
- `get`
- `assoc`
- `dissoc`

Also adds exit instructions to the REPL welcome message.

## v0.1.1

Fix broken `lasp` executable.

## v0.1.0

First release.
